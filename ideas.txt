TODO: Small utility
- Add regularization
- Add softmax activation function
- Improve precision of the metrics display during the training (Moving accuracy and SSE)
- Implement the HDense layer

TODO: Medium utility
- Implement the dynamic dense layer.
- Train a model on ImageNet
- Retrieve results for the HCNN models and GPU implementation:
 (1) Model robustness, i.e. adversarial images (section 7.13) + master thesis (dropbox)
 (2) Features learned, i.e. comparison with Dropout & Neuron mining

TODO: Big utility
- Implement more complex model neural networks:
 (1) Allow non-sequential neural network
 (2) Allow network to contains networks (composite design patterns), i.e. Inception Module is a network and the GoogleNet contains many of them.
 (3) Implement ResNet, AlexNet, GoogleNet, ...
