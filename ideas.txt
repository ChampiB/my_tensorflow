TODO: Project direction / readings
- Adversarial image (section 7.13)
- Dropout
- Neuron mining

TODO: Small utility
- Add regularization
- Add softmax activation function
- Improve precision of the metrics display during the training (Moving accuracy and SSE)
- Add a Builder named trainingConfig which can be passed to the cnn.NeuralNetwork's fit method
- Implement the HDense layer

TODO: Medium utility
- Allow to save and reload the network
- Train a model on ImageNet
- Implement more complex model, e.g. ResNet, AlexNet, ...

TODO: Big utility
- Create a GPU implementation of the HCNN layer (hardware acceleration)
